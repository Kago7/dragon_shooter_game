try catch surround collision catch exception indexoutofbounds checking for fireballs and monsters

commented notes:

// this try catch catches all array
					 * index exceptions wehn checking for // collisions. This is because the arrays
					 * are accessed in different threads and // are not sychronized. Thus, we get
					 * errors, especially when both arrays are // accessed in quick succession like
					 * when the fireball is shot rigth with a // monster in front of it-this is a
					 * race condition. We haven't learned how to // make synced collections so I'm
					 * just gonna catch all the exception to reduce // console error clutter-for
					 * asthetic.
